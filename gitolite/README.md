This add-on allows you to host a Lightweight Git Server - gitolite.

## About

IN DEVELOPMENT! TO DO NOT USE

This add-on allows you to host a Lightweight Git Server, giving you access to your
repositories/projects over ssh.
It also includes a access control to Control who can Read/Write to repositories.

## WARNING

While this add-on is created and maintained with care and with security in mind,
in the wrong or inexperienced hands, it could damage your system.

## Features

This add-on, of course, provides an gitolite server, based on [gitolite][gitolite].
Additionally, it comes out of the box with the following:

- Add new repositories
- Control access to your repositories

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Search for the "Gitolite" add-on in the Supervisor add-on store
   and install it.
1. Configure the `username` and `password`/`authorized_keys` options.
1. Start the "Gitolite" add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "Gitolite" add-on to see if everything
    went well.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

SSH add-on configuration:

```yaml
gitolite:
  repositories: [
    project: 'project1',
    read: [user1, user2],
    write: [user2]
  ]
  users: [
    name: 'user1',
    password: 'passwd',
    authorized_keys:
      - ssh-rsa AASDJKJKJFWJFAFLCNALCMLAK234234.....
  ]
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_
